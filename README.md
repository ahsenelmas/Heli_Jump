# Helicopter Game in Python

Welcome to the Helicopter Game! This project is a simple yet entertaining game built using Python and the Pygame library. In this game, players control a helicopter, dodging obstacles to achieve the highest score possible. The game showcases basic game development concepts with Pygame, including game loops, event handling, and collision detection.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can run the game, you'll need to have Python installed on your computer. Additionally, this game requires Pygame. If you don't have Pygame installed, you can install it using pip:

```
pip install pygame
```

### Running the Game

To play the game, simply clone this repository or download the `helicopter-game.py` file. Then, navigate to the downloaded directory in your terminal and run the following command:

```
python helicopter-game.py
```

### Controls

- **Spacebar**: Press and hold to fly up; release to descend.
- **Enter**: Restart the game after a collision.
